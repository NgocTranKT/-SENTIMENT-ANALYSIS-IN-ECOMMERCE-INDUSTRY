2. Method

Step 1: Collecting data

Craw data:
Link website:

Step 2: Determining the categories and labeling
I need to determine which categories this data will be organized into. Then I need to
classify a small portion of our data manually.

Step 3: Machine Learning

For this step, the user manually classifies a small portion of data so the machine can learn
from it. The critical point here is that the more data is classified manually, the better the
machine learns, and the higher the accuracy rate becomes.
The user then uploads the data, some portion of which is already classified, to the system.
I use a set of ready-to-use Machine Learning models for the most common use cases
like sentiment, emotion, complaint, and hate speech analyses.

Step 4: Automatic Data Classification

With the help of its smart algorithm, the machine uses this information and classifies the
rest of the data.

Step 5: Transforming Analyzed Data into Insights

After the automatic data classification phase, I export my database.
By filtering only negative comments about Amazon experiences, it can now see what kind
of problems people have when using it.
